# Hand Writing Digits Recognition

Hand Writing Digits Recognition program is an open-source python machine learning algorithm program.
That program recognizes and predicts handwriting digits.

This project prepared to recognize and predict the handwriting digits both using Deep Learning and Machine Learning algortihms together.

In order, you have to install additional packages to work with this repository :

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pydigit.

```bash
pip install DigitRecognizer
```

## Index and Usage

This python project includes three of python files:
***
DigitRecognizer.success():
Includes main.py that shows the algorithm stats.
That stats are : How successfull and How many loss points algorithm have ?
***
DigitRecognizer.random(): 
Includes python file that is a handwriting digit predicter. 
That predicter picks random handwiritng digits from MINST algorithm and predicts both.
***
DigitRecognizer.recognize():
Includes python file that is a handwriting digit predicter. 
First of all you have to add a 28x28 image to your dir which python file you are working in that.
After that, give the image name as a parameter to the recognize() function. 
Finally let the program predicts your own handwriting digits.
